### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning operations research
- ðŸ”­ Here are several operations research-related projects :
1. Writing a solver for Picross (Nonogram) using constraint programming tools*
2. Solving the Travelling Salesperson Problem using a Genetic Algorithm
  - Benchmarking and comparisons could be done, using ConcordeTSP as reference
3. Push-Relabel (Goldberg) Algorithm on flows, on Java
